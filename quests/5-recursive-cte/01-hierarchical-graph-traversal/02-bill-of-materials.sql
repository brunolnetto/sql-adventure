-- =====================================================
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for complex hierarchical cost calculations
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES:
--   - Understand multi-level cost aggregation in hierarchical structures
--   - Learn to calculate total costs including subcomponents
--   - Master recursive CTE with complex business logic
-- EXPECTED RESULTS: Complete cost breakdown for each product including subcomponents
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, Cost Aggregation, Hierarchical Calculations, Business Logic

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for calculating total product costs
--          including subcomponent costs in a bill of materials structure
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to use recursive CTEs for
--                    hierarchical cost calculations, aggregating values up
--                    the hierarchy, and managing complex product structures
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. Total cost calculation including direct and component costs
-- 2. Hierarchical cost aggregation from leaf components to final products
-- 3. Level tracking for component depth analysis
-- 4. Cost breakdown showing direct vs component costs
-- 5. Complex product structure cost analysis
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, hierarchical aggregation, cost calculation, bill of materials, component analysis

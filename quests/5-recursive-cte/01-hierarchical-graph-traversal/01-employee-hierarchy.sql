-- Recursive CTE quest: Employee Hierarchy Traversal
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate basic recursive CTE for hierarchical data traversal
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES:
--   - Understand parent-child relationship traversal
--   - Learn to build hierarchical paths using recursion
--   - Master basic recursive CTE patterns with level tracking
-- EXPECTED RESULTS: Complete employee hierarchy with levels and full paths
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¢ Beginner (5-10 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, Hierarchical Data, Parent-Child Relationships, Level Tracking

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for traversing employee organizational
--          hierarchy and building complete hierarchy paths from CEO to employees
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to use recursive CTEs for
--                    hierarchical data traversal, building path strings, and
--                    managing hierarchical relationships in organizational structures
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. Complete employee hierarchy with levels from CEO (0) to employees
-- 2. Hierarchy paths showing the complete chain of command
-- 3. Department-based organizational structure
-- 4. Salary information at each hierarchy level
-- 5. Hierarchical data traversal from root to leaves
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¢ Beginner (5-10 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, hierarchical data, organizational structure, path building, level tracking

-- Clean up existing tables (idempotent)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees CASCADE;

-- Create sample employee table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'John CEO', NULL, 'Executive', 100000),
(2, 'Alice VP', 1, 'Engineering', 80000),
(3, 'Bob Manager', 2, 'Engineering', 60000),
(4, 'Carol Dev', 3, 'Engineering', 50000),
(5, 'David Dev', 3, 'Engineering', 52000),
(6, 'Eve VP', 1, 'Marketing', 75000),
(7, 'Frank Manager', 6, 'Marketing', 55000),
(8, 'Grace Specialist', 7, 'Marketing', 45000);

-- Find complete hierarchy for each employee
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case: employees with no manager (CEO)
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        department,
        salary,
        0 AS level,
        CAST(name AS VARCHAR(500)) AS hierarchy_path
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: employees with managers
    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        e.department,
        e.salary,
        eh.level + 1,
        CAST(eh.hierarchy_path || ' â†’ ' || e.name AS VARCHAR(500))
    FROM employees AS e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy AS eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)

SELECT
    level,
    name,
    department,
    salary,
    hierarchy_path
FROM employee_hierarchy
ORDER BY level, name;

-- Clean up
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees CASCADE;

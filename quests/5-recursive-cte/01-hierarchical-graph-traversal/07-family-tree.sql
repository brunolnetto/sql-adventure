-- Family Tree Example
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for complex family relationship analysis
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES:
--   - Understand multi-relationship hierarchical data traversal
--   - Learn to handle complex family tree structures with multiple parent types
--   - Master recursive CTE with multiple relationship paths
-- EXPECTED RESULTS: Complete family tree with generations and lineage paths
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, Complex Hierarchies, Multiple Relationships, Lineage Analysis

-- Clean up existing tables (idempotent)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS family_members CASCADE;

-- Create table to represent family relationships
CREATE TABLE family_members (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    birth_date DATE,
    death_date DATE,
    gender CHAR(1), -- 'M' for Male, 'F' for Female
    father_id INT,
    mother_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (father_id) REFERENCES family_members(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (mother_id) REFERENCES family_members(id)
);

-- Insert sample family data
INSERT INTO family_members VALUES

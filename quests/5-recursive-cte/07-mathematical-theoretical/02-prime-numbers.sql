-- Prime Number Generation Example
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for generating prime numbers using the sieve method
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES:
--   - Understand prime number generation and primality testing algorithms
--   - Learn to use arrays and recursion for mathematical algorithms
--   - Master iterative filtering and sequence building for prime numbers
-- EXPECTED RESULTS: Generate all prime numbers up to 20
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸ”´ Advanced (15-30 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Prime number generation, sieve algorithms, mathematical recursion, primality testing

-- Generate prime numbers using a simpler approach

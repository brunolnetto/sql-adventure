-- Factorial Calculation Example
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for mathematical factorial calculation
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES:
--   - Understand factorial mathematical concept (n! = n * (n-1)!)
--   - Learn recursive multiplication patterns in SQL
--   - Master iterative mathematical calculations with recursion
-- EXPECTED RESULTS: Calculate factorials from 0! to 10! (1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800)
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¢ Beginner (5-10 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Mathematical recursion, factorial calculation, iterative multiplication, mathematical sequences

-- Calculate factorials from 0 to 10
WITH RECURSIVE factorial AS (
    -- Base case: 0! = 1
    SELECT
        0 AS n,
        1 AS factorial_value

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    SELECT
        n + 1,
        (n + 1) * factorial_value
    FROM factorial
    WHERE n < 10
)

SELECT
    n,
    factorial_value,
    CASE
        WHEN n <= 10 THEN factorial_value::VARCHAR
        ELSE 'Too large to display'
    END AS display_value
FROM factorial
ORDER BY n;

-- Recursive CTE: Longest Work Streak Analysis
-- =====================================================

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for analyzing continuous work streaks
--          and identifying patterns in employee attendance data
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to use recursive CTEs for
--                    pattern recognition, streak analysis, and identifying
--                    continuous sequences in time series data
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. Longest continuous work streaks identified for each employee
-- 2. Streak start and end dates calculated
-- 3. Total hours worked during streaks
-- 4. Pattern recognition in attendance data
-- 5. Continuous sequence analysis in time series
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, pattern recognition, streak analysis, time series, continuous sequences, attendance tracking

-- Recursive CTE: Password Generation with Pattern Rules
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for generating password patterns with character set rules
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES:
--   - Understand pattern-based string generation using recursion
--   - Learn to apply rules for character selection and pattern building
--   - Master recursive string building with conditional logic and character sets
-- EXPECTED RESULTS: Generate 12-character passwords following alternating character set rules
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Pattern generation, string building, conditional recursion, character sets

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for generating password patterns
--          with specific character set rules and complexity requirements
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to use recursive CTEs for
--                    pattern generation, string building, and implementing
--                    complex generation rules with character set tracking
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. 12-character passwords generated with pattern rules
-- 2. Character set diversity tracking (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special)
-- 3. Password strength assessment based on character variety
-- 4. Pattern-based character placement (every 2nd, 3rd, 4th position)
-- 5. Complex generation rules implementation
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, pattern generation, string building, character sets, password complexity, generation rules

--   - Learn to implement mathematical algorithms with branching logic
--   - Master complex iterative calculations with termination conditions
-- EXPECTED RESULTS: Complete Collatz sequence for number 27 with step-by-step progression
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, Conditional Logic, Mathematical Algorithms, Sequence Generation

-- Calculate Collatz sequence for number 27

-- Recursive CTE: Graph Reachability Analysis
-- =====================================================

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate recursive CTE for analyzing graph reachability
--          and finding all nodes reachable from a starting point
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to use recursive CTEs for
--                    graph traversal, path tracking, and reachability analysis
--                    in directed graph structures
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. All nodes reachable from starting node identified
-- 2. Shortest path distances calculated
-- 3. Path tracking from source to destination nodes
-- 4. Graph traversal with distance measurement
-- 5. Reachability analysis in directed graphs
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸ”´ Advanced (15-30 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Recursive CTE, graph traversal, reachability analysis, path finding, distance calculation, directed graphs

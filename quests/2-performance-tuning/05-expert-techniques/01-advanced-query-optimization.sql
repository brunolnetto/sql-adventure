-- Example 1: Query Rewriting for Performance
-- Demonstrate rewriting queries for better performance

-- Create sample tables with large datasets
CREATE TABLE sales_transactions (

    category VARCHAR(100),
    brand VARCHAR(100),
    unit_cost DECIMAL(10,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert large sample dataset
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name, email, city, state, country, customer_segment)
SELECT 
    generate_series(1, 10000) as customer_id,
    'Customer ' || generate_series(1, 10000) as customer_name,
    'customer' || generate_series(1, 10000) || '@email.com' as email,
    CASE (random() * 4)::int
        WHEN 0 THEN 'New York'

    CASE (random() * 2)::int

    END as customer_segment;

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, category, brand, unit_cost)
SELECT

INSERT INTO sales_transactions (customer_id, product_id, sale_date, quantity, unit_price, total_amount, region, salesperson_id)
SELECT

-- Create comprehensive indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_customer_date ON sales_transactions(customer_id, sale_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_product_date ON sales_transactions(product_id, sale_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_region_date ON sales_transactions(region, sale_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_amount ON sales_transactions(total_amount);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_segment ON customers(customer_segment);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON products(category);

-- Example 2: Complex Query Optimization
-- Demonstrate optimizing complex analytical queries

-- POOR: Complex query with multiple subqueries
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    c.customer_segment,
    COUNT(s.transaction_id) as total_transactions,
    SUM(s.total_amount) as total_spent,
    AVG(s.total_amount) as avg_transaction,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_transactions s2 
     WHERE s2.customer_id = c.customer_id 
     AND s2.sale_date >= '2024-06-01') as recent_transactions
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN sales_transactions s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_segment = 'Premium'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.customer_segment
HAVING COUNT(s.transaction_id) > 5;

-- BETTER: Optimized query with CTEs and pre-aggregation
WITH customer_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(transaction_id) as total_transactions,
        SUM(total_amount) as total_spent,
        AVG(total_amount) as avg_transaction
    FROM sales_transactions
    GROUP BY customer_id
),
recent_transactions AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as recent_count
    FROM sales_transactions
    WHERE sale_date >= '2024-06-01'
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    c.customer_segment,
    COALESCE(cs.total_transactions, 0) as total_transactions,
    COALESCE(cs.total_spent, 0) as total_spent,
    COALESCE(cs.avg_transaction, 0) as avg_transaction,
    COALESCE(rt.recent_count, 0) as recent_transactions
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN customer_stats cs ON c.customer_id = cs.customer_id
LEFT JOIN recent_transactions rt ON c.customer_id = rt.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_segment = 'Premium'
  AND COALESCE(cs.total_transactions, 0) > 5
ORDER BY cs.total_spent DESC;

-- Example 3: Materialized Views for Performance
-- Demonstrate using materialized views for complex aggregations

-- Create materialized view for customer analytics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_customer_analytics AS
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    c.customer_segment,
    c.city,
    c.state,
    COUNT(s.transaction_id) as total_transactions,
    SUM(s.total_amount) as total_spent,
    AVG(s.total_amount) as avg_transaction,
    MIN(s.sale_date) as first_purchase,
    MAX(s.sale_date) as last_purchase,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.product_id) as unique_products,
    COUNT(DISTINCT DATE_TRUNC('month', s.sale_date)) as active_months
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN sales_transactions s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.customer_segment, c.city, c.state;

-- Create index on materialized view
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_customer_segment ON mv_customer_analytics(customer_segment);
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_total_spent ON mv_customer_analytics(total_spent);

-- Query using materialized view (much faster)
SELECT 
    customer_segment,
    COUNT(*) as customer_count,
    AVG(total_spent) as avg_total_spent,
    SUM(total_spent) as segment_total
FROM mv_customer_analytics
WHERE total_transactions > 5
GROUP BY customer_segment
ORDER BY segment_total DESC;

-- Example 4: Advanced Indexing Strategies
-- Demonstrate advanced indexing techniques

-- Partial indexes for specific conditions
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_premium_customers ON sales_transactions(customer_id, sale_date)
WHERE total_amount > 1000;

CREATE INDEX idx_sales_recent ON sales_transactions(sale_date, customer_id)
WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- Expression indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email_domain ON customers(SUBSTRING(email FROM '@(.*)$'));

-- Query using partial index
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(s.transaction_id) as high_value_transactions,
    SUM(s.total_amount) as high_value_total
FROM customers c
JOIN sales_transactions s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.total_amount > 1000
  AND s.sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
ORDER BY high_value_total DESC;

-- Example 5: Query Hints and Optimization
-- Demonstrate using query hints for optimization

-- Force index usage
SELECT /*+ INDEX(sales_transactions idx_sales_customer_date) */
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(s.transaction_id) as transaction_count
FROM customers c
JOIN sales_transactions s ON c.customer_id = s.customer_id
WHERE s.sale_date >= '2024-06-01'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
ORDER BY transaction_count DESC;

-- Example 6: Performance Monitoring
-- Demonstrate monitoring query performance

-- Check index usage
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch,
    idx_blks_read,
    idx_blks_hit
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('sales_transactions', 'customers', 'products')
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Check table statistics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins,
    n_tup_upd,
    n_tup_del,
    n_live_tup,
    n_dead_tup,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE tablename IN ('sales_transactions', 'customers', 'products');

-- Clean up
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_customer_analytics CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales_transactions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products CASCADE;

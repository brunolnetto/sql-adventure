-- Clean up existing tables (idempotent)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS order_items CASCADE;

-- Create sample tables with realistic data

    name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INTEGER,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true

CREATE TABLE orders (

-- Example 1: EXISTS vs IN Performance Comparison
-- EXISTS is generally more efficient than IN for large datasets

-- Using IN (can be slower for large subqueries)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.customer_id IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT o.customer_id
    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE o.total_amount > 1000
);

-- Using EXISTS (usually more efficient)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    c.email
FROM customers AS c
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE
        o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        AND o.total_amount > 1000
);

-- Example 2: Correlated Subquery Optimization
-- Correlated subqueries can be slow - consider alternatives

-- POOR: Correlated subquery (executes for each row)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders AS o
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id)
        AS order_count,
    (
        SELECT MAX(o.total_amount) FROM orders AS o
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ) AS max_order
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.status = 'active';

-- BETTER: Using JOIN with aggregation
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count,
    MAX(o.total_amount) AS max_order
FROM customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name;

-- Example 3: CTE vs Subquery Performance
-- CTEs can improve readability and sometimes performance

-- Using subquery (can be hard to read)
SELECT
    p.name,
    p.category,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items AS oi
        INNER JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
        WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id AND o.status = 'completed'
    ) AS sales_count,
    (
        SELECT SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) FROM order_items AS oi
        INNER JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
        WHERE oi.product_id = p.product_id AND o.status = 'completed'
    ) AS total_revenue
FROM products AS p
WHERE p.is_active = true;

-- Using CTE (more readable and potentially faster)
WITH product_sales AS (
    SELECT
        oi.product_id,
        COUNT(*) AS sales_count,
        SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue
    FROM order_items AS oi
    INNER JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
    WHERE o.status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY oi.product_id
)

SELECT
    p.name,
    p.category,
    COALESCE(ps.sales_count, 0) AS sales_count,
    COALESCE(ps.total_revenue, 0) AS total_revenue
FROM products AS p
LEFT JOIN product_sales AS ps ON p.product_id = ps.product_id
WHERE p.is_active = true;

-- Example 4: Lateral Joins for Complex Subqueries
-- Lateral joins can be more efficient than correlated subqueries

-- Using correlated subquery
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    (
        SELECT oi.product_id
        FROM order_items AS oi
        INNER JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        ORDER BY oi.quantity * oi.unit_price DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS top_product_id
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.status = 'active';

-- Using lateral join (more efficient)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    top_product.product_id
FROM customers AS c
CROSS JOIN
    LATERAL (
        SELECT oi.product_id
        FROM order_items AS oi
        INNER JOIN orders AS o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        ORDER BY oi.quantity * oi.unit_price DESC
        LIMIT 1
    ) AS top_product
WHERE c.status = 'active';

-- Example 5: Subquery in SELECT vs JOIN
-- Choose the right approach based on your needs

-- Using subquery in SELECT (executes for each row)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    (
        SELECT SUM(o.total_amount) FROM orders AS o
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id
    ) AS total_spent,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders AS o
        WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id)
        AS order_count
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.status = 'active';

-- Using JOIN with aggregation (usually more efficient)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    COALESCE(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) AS total_spent,
    COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM customers AS c
LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.status = 'active'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name;

-- Example 6: Optimizing NOT EXISTS vs NOT IN
-- NOT EXISTS is generally safer and more efficient than NOT IN

-- Using NOT IN (can have issues with NULL values)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
FROM customers AS c
WHERE c.customer_id NOT IN (
    SELECT o.customer_id
    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE o.status = 'completed'
);

-- Using NOT EXISTS (safer and more efficient)
SELECT
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
FROM customers AS c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders AS o
    WHERE
        o.customer_id = c.customer_id
        AND o.status = 'completed'
);

-- Example 7: Subquery with Window Functions
-- Combine subqueries with window functions for complex analysis

-- Find customers with above-average spending
WITH customer_stats AS (
    SELECT
        c.customer_id,
        c.first_name,
        c.last_name,
        SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent,
        AVG(SUM(o.total_amount)) OVER () AS avg_customer_spending
    FROM customers AS c
    LEFT JOIN orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name
)

SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    total_spent,
    avg_customer_spending
FROM customer_stats
WHERE total_spent > avg_customer_spending
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- Example 8: Recursive CTE vs Subquery
-- Use recursive CTEs for hierarchical data instead of subqueries

-- Using subquery for hierarchical data (inefficient)
SELECT
    p.name,
    p.category,
    (
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products AS p2
        WHERE p2.category = p.category)
        AS category_count
FROM products AS p;

-- Using window function (more efficient)
SELECT
    p.name,
    p.category,
    COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY p.category) AS category_count
FROM products AS p;

-- Clean up
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS order_items CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS products CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customers CASCADE;

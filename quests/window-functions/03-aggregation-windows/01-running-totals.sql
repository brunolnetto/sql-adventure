-- Window Functions: Running Totals and Cumulative Sums
-- =====================================================

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate basic window function aggregation for running totals
--          and cumulative calculations across time series data
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to use SUM() OVER() 
--                    for running totals, cumulative sums, and time-based aggregations
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. Running totals calculated across time periods
-- 2. Cumulative sums with and without partitioning
-- 3. Running averages and percentages
-- 4. Financial analysis with cumulative metrics
-- 5. Customer transaction analysis with running balances

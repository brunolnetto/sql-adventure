# Window Functions Quest ü™ü

Master the power of window functions for advanced data analytics and reporting in SQL.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

Window functions are one of the most powerful features in SQL for data analysis. They allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row, without reducing the number of rows returned.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Ranking functions** - ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK()
- **Aggregation windows** - Running totals, moving averages
- **Partitioned analytics** - Group-based calculations
- **Lead/Lag functions** - Time series analysis
- **Frame specifications** - Custom window boundaries

## üìä Difficulty Level Evaluation

FROM products;
```

### **3. Master Aggregation Windows**
```sql
-- Running totals
SELECT 
    date,
    sales_amount,
    SUM(sales_amount) OVER (ORDER BY date) as running_total
FROM daily_sales;
```

## üîß Key Window Function Concepts

### **1. OVER Clause**
```sql
-- Basic window function
SELECT 
    column1,
    column2,
    window_function() OVER (window_definition) as result
FROM table_name;
```

### **2. PARTITION BY**
```sql
-- Partition by category
SELECT 
    product_name,
    category,
    price,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY price DESC) as rank
FROM products;
```

### **3. ORDER BY**
```sql
-- Order by date for time series
SELECT 
    date,
    sales,
    SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY date) as running_total
FROM daily_sales;
```

### **4. Frame Specification**
```sql
-- 3-day moving average
SELECT 
    date,
    sales,
    AVG(sales) OVER (
        ORDER BY date 
        ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as moving_avg_3d
FROM daily_sales;
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

### **Optimization Tips**
- **Use appropriate indexes** on ORDER BY columns
- **Limit window size** for large datasets
- **Consider materialized views** for complex calculations
- **Monitor execution plans** for performance issues

### **Common Pitfalls**
- **Unbounded windows** can cause performance issues
- **Complex frame specifications** may be slow
- **Large partitions** can consume significant memory
- **Missing indexes** on partition/order columns

## üéØ Advanced Patterns

### **1. Gap Analysis**
```sql
-- Find gaps in sequences
WITH gaps AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        LAG(id) OVER (ORDER BY id) as prev_id,
        id - LAG(id) OVER (ORDER BY id) as gap_size
    FROM sequence_table
)
SELECT * FROM gaps WHERE gap_size > 1;
```

### **2. Trend Detection**
```sql
-- Detect trends using moving averages
SELECT 
    date,
    value,
    AVG(value) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS 6 PRECEDING) as ma_7d,
    CASE 
        WHEN value > AVG(value) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS 6 PRECEDING) 
        THEN 'Above Trend'
        ELSE 'Below Trend'
    END as trend
FROM time_series_data;
```

### **3. Percentile Analysis**
```sql
-- Calculate percentiles
SELECT 
    product_name,
    price,
    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY price) as price_percentile,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY price) as price_quartile
FROM products;
```

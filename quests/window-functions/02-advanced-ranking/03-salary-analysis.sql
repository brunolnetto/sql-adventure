-- Window Functions: Complex Salary Analysis with Multiple Functions
-- =====================================================

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate complex salary analysis using multiple window functions for
--          comprehensive business analytics including distributions, equity analysis,
--          and performance correlation across departments and experience levels
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to combine multiple window functions
--                    for comprehensive salary analysis, including percentile calculations,
--                    equity analysis, and performance correlation patterns
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. Multiple percentile functions applied to salary distribution analysis
-- 2. Salary bands created using NTILE with distribution analysis
-- 3. Statistical measures calculated for salary distributions by department
-- 4. Salary equity analysis across departments and experience levels
-- 5. Department performance analysis with salary correlation metrics
-- 6. Comprehensive salary report with multiple ranking and analysis dimensions
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸ”´ Advanced (15-30 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Multiple window functions, PERCENT_RANK(), NTILE(), salary distributions, equity analysis, performance correlation, statistical measures

-- Window Functions: Complex Salary Analysis with Multiple Functions
-- =====================================================

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate complex salary analysis using multiple window functions for
--          comprehensive business analytics including distributions, equity analysis,
--          and performance correlation across departments and experience levels
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to combine multiple window functions
--                    for comprehensive salary analysis, including percentile calculations,
--                    equity analysis, and performance correlation patterns
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. Multiple percentile functions applied to salary distribution analysis
-- 2. Salary bands created using NTILE with distribution analysis
-- 3. Statistical measures calculated for salary distributions by department
-- 4. Salary equity analysis across departments and experience levels
-- 5. Department performance analysis with salary correlation metrics
-- 6. Comprehensive salary report with multiple ranking and analysis dimensions
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸ”´ Advanced (15-30 min)
-- CONCEPTS: Multiple window functions, PERCENT_RANK(), NTILE(), salary distributions, equity analysis, performance correlation, statistical measures

-- Clean up existing tables (idempotent)

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate PERCENT_RANK() and NTILE() functions for percentile
--          calculations and creating equal-sized groups for salary analysis
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand how to use PERCENT_RANK() for
--                    percentile calculations and NTILE() for creating equal-sized
--                    groups for salary analysis and performance tiers
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. PERCENT_RANK() calculates percentile ranks for salary distribution
-- 2. NTILE() creates salary quartiles and quintiles
-- 3. Department-based percentile analysis
-- 4. Performance tiers based on percentile ranks
-- 5. Salary bands created using NTILE
-- 6. Top performers identified by percentile
-- 7. Salary equity analysis using percentiles
-- 8. Multiple percentile functions compared
-- 9. Salary distribution analysis across departments
-- 10. Market positioning analysis using percentiles
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate (10-20 min)

-- Window Functions: Advanced Salary Analysis
-- =====================================================

-- PURPOSE: Demonstrate advanced salary analysis using multiple window functions
--          including NTILE, PERCENT_RANK, and complex analytical patterns
-- LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students will understand complex salary analysis patterns
--                    including salary bands, equity analysis, and distribution analysis
-- EXPECTED RESULTS:
-- 1. Salary band creation with NTILE
-- 2. Multiple percentile function comparisons
-- 3. Salary distribution analysis
-- 4. Salary equity analysis
-- 5. Department performance analysis
-- DIFFICULTY: ðŸ”´ Advanced (15-30 min)
-- CONCEPTS: NTILE(), PERCENT_RANK(), salary analysis, equity analysis, distribution analysis

-- Clean up existing tables (idempotent)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employee_salaries CASCADE;

-- Create sample employee salaries table

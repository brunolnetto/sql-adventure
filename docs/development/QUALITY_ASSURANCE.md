## üõ†Ô∏è **Operational Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Development & Initial Testing**

#### **Step 1: Query Development with Context**
```bash
# 1. Create new example file with context header
touch quests/[quest-name]/[category]/[example-name].sql

# 2. Follow enhanced template structure
# - Context header with educational purpose
# - Expected results specification
# - Clean up existing tables (idempotent)
# - Create sample data
# - Execute query with clear examples
# - Validation queries for expected results
# - Clean up tables
```

#### **Step 2: Local Testing with Context Validation**
```bash
# Test individual example with context validation
./scripts/quality-check.sh validate-with-context quests/[quest-name]/[category]/[example-name].sql

# Test entire category with context validation
./scripts/quality-check.sh quest-with-context [quest-name] [category]

# Test entire quest with context validation
./scripts/quality-check.sh quest-with-context [quest-name]
```

#### **Step 3: Quality Validation with Expected Results**
```bash
# Run comprehensive quality assurance checks including context
./scripts/quality-check.sh validate-with-context [example-file]

# Check for common issues and context compliance
./scripts/quality-check.sh lint-with-context [example-file]
```

### **Phase 2: Automated Testing with Context**

#### **Step 4: CI/CD Integration with Context Validation**
```bash
# Automated testing on commit with context validation
./scripts/ci-test-with-context.sh

# Performance benchmarking with context validation
./scripts/performance-test-with-context.sh [example-file]
```

#### **Step 5: Regression Testing with Context**
```bash
# Test all examples with context validation
./scripts/regression-test-with-context.sh

# Validate no breaking changes and context compliance
./scripts/breaking-changes-with-context.sh
```

### **Phase 3: Documentation & Review with Context**

#### **Step 6: Documentation Update with Context**
```bash
# Update README files with context information
./scripts/update-docs-with-context.sh

# Generate example index with context
./scripts/generate-index-with-context.sh
```

#### **Step 7: Final Review with Context Validation**
```bash
# Code review checklist with context validation
./scripts/review-checklist-with-context.sh [example-file]

# User experience validation with context
./scripts/ux-validation-with-context.sh [example-file]
```

### **2. Enhanced Example Template with Context**

```sql
-- =====================================================
-- Window Functions: Sales Ranking Example
-- =====================================================

-- Context: This example demonstrates how to use ROW_NUMBER() 
--          to rank sales data by amount within categories.
-- Purpose: Teach basic window function ranking concepts
-- Learning Outcome: Students will understand how to use 
--                   ROW_NUMBER() for ranking data

-- Expected Results:
-- 1. Products should be ranked by sales amount (highest first)
-- 2. Each category should have its own ranking sequence
-- 3. No ties should occur (ROW_NUMBER() gives unique ranks)
-- 4. Electronics category should have 3 products ranked 1,2,3
-- 5. Clothing category should have 2 products ranked 1,2

-- Clean up existing tables (idempotent)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales_data CASCADE;

-- Create sample sales table
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(50),
    sale_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO sales_data VALUES
(1, 'Laptop Pro', 'Electronics', 1200.00, '2024-01-15'),
(2, 'Wireless Mouse', 'Electronics', 45.00, '2024-01-16'),
(3, 'Office Chair', 'Furniture', 299.99, '2024-01-17'),
(4, 'Desk Lamp', 'Furniture', 89.99, '2024-01-18'),
(5, 'Gaming Keyboard', 'Electronics', 150.00, '2024-01-19');

-- Demonstrate window functions
SELECT 
    product_name,
    category,
    sale_amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as overall_rank,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as category_rank
FROM sales_data
ORDER BY sale_amount DESC;

-- Validation: Verify expected results
-- Validation 1: Check that Electronics has 3 products
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) as product_count
FROM sales_data 
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY category;

-- Validation 2: Check that highest sale amount is ranked 1
SELECT 
    product_name,
    sale_amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) as rank
FROM sales_data
WHERE ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sale_amount DESC) = 1;

-- Validation 3: Verify no duplicate ranks within categories
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) as total_products,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY sale_amount DESC)) as unique_ranks
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY category;

-- Clean up
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales_data CASCADE;
```
